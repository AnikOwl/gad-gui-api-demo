The Weird and The Eerie are closely related but distinct modes, each possessing its own distinct properties. Both have often been associated with Horror, yet this emphasis overlooks the aching fascination that such texts can exercise. The Weird and the Eerie both fundamentally concern the outside and the unknown, which are not intrinsically horrifying, even if they are always unsettling."

Coraz lepiej poznajemy prawa rządzące rzeczywistością – nie przez ustanawianie świętych prawd, ale ich skuteczne podważanie. Wizja świata, która dzięki temu zaczęła się rysować, jest dogłębnie szokująca. By ją nam przybliżyć, Andrzej Dragan w jasny i klarowny sposób objaśnia niezwykłe wnioski wynikające z przełomowych teorii Einsteina oraz najbardziej zaskakujące prawa mechaniki kwantowej, a także przedstawia własny, nowy i rewolucyjny model łączący je ze sobą."
